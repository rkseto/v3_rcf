Instructions for running AMPT for v3 studies Jan 25, 2022

Areas: 
on RCF
workarea :  /star/data01/pwg/rseto
Generation
area: v3/ampt/generate       Ampt code is here
then areas 3 3melt etc
submit jobs
//1) single jobs typically for a centrality cut  (10K events)  in area /3/condor_ampt.job << done on unbutu on my machine
2) multiple jobs to generate many events (e.g. 1M)  
a) condor_ampt.job (e.g. 350 jobs) and condor_ampt.csh   will need template area
uses areas  /3/jobs      (and .logs)
input_3AuAu.ampt   controls jobs
b) in jobs, run catit to cat all the .dat files into e.g. 35 files for doing analysis
this is for 1M events
for smaller files - e.g. 10K - just cat all the .dat files and put them in the ana area.


/3/ and /3melt/ 1M events minbias-multiple jobs-multiple outfile files on RCF and 10K(bcut)-generated on unbutu - single output
/5/ /5melt/ 10K(bcut)-generated on unbutu - single output
/8/ /8melt/  10K bcut generated in multiple jobs on RCF - single output
/19/  /19melt/  10K bcut generated in multiple jobs on RCF - single output
/200/  /200melt/  10K bcut generated in multiple jobs on RCF - single output
There is a watchit 

analyzing jobs
area: amptana
program amptana3.C
for running jobs interactively:  macros - doit3, doitall3   note: 200 GeV files get error after 9K events
for running multiple jobs in batch: (3.g. 3 min bias with 1M events)
area: ./run3/ and ./run3melt/
runamptana.job  and .csh
    --> to make b cut, change bmin and bmax in runamptana.csh
   right now only 3 GeV and 3melt is set up.
use hadit.csh to had jobs.
 there is a watchit to watch jobs

Studying .root files and making plots
   move to unbutu

on RCF move .root files to ~/tran/amptroot

on unbutu
  start fzfiles 
move files to /work/amptana/rcfroot
root amptanaplot1.C

output is png files
