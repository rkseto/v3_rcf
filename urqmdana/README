edit runurqmdana.csh to set the energy correctly. - you may have to fool around with this.
set the variable - bmin, bmax, set number, pot, numevt
the set number is a number  you can set to differentiate different jobs. I usually go 1, 2, 3,

check to see if one job runs 
runurqmdana.csh 0

runurqmd.job - change to submit the right number of jobs then
condor_submit runurqmd.job

all log files will be in logs

output files - in jobs there will be a directorly for a particular run.
In the will be the output files.

cd jobs
../haddit3.csh 
  you will have to give it energies etc.
