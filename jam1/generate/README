Run Jam
make a new area: e.g. Jam1_3GeV_b0-14_RQMDS
make area coalesc and run
in both coalesc and run cp -d -r ../../template/coalesc/* .      run/* .
in run: edit convert.cc
then as readme says
1. conf.mk: control the number of jobs   - right now each job does 500 events - controled in covert - turning on potentials - each job takes ~ 2hrs
2. compile the code: make clone
3. run the jobs: ./submit confirm

then go to Data
../catithadd Jam1_3GeV_b0-14_RQMDS

mv convert* junk and delete
Move all root files made by hadd to run jam1ana5  (right now on my laptop)

-------------------------------
Coalesc

In coalesc put root files from run/Data into filelist
then follow readme
1. main function: dist.cc
2. conf.mk: control the number of jobs
3. compile the code: make clone
4. run the jobs: ./submit confirm
5. the final root files are saved in Data/

on coalecs
- make a haddit
- make a cq
